## ember-cli-jsx

This addon inserts adds `jsx` processing into the javascript preprocessor for Ember CLI.

### Installation / Usage

From within your Ember CLI application (must be >= 0.1.2), run the following:

```bash
npm install --save-dev ember-cli-jsx
```

That's all. You can now use ES6 syntax supported by `jsx` in your `.jsx`
files.

### Other things

At some point I should probably expand this into a full on
`ember-cli-react` addon using trinkets from
[ember-react](https://github.com/ghempton/ember-react)
but for now you'll probably want to `bower install react --save`.
